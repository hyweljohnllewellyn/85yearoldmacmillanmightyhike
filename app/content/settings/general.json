It's an opportunity to share this fantastic experience with my family, enjoying every moment.\\\n\\\nI started fundraising for Macmillan since my father was diagnosed with cancer and received support from Macmillan.\\\n\\\nIn 2021, I was shortlisted in [South Wales Evening Post Community Award fundraising category](https://www.facebook.com/macmillan.cymruwales/photos/a.640296012680395/3915836351792995)\n\n\\\n[You can follow me on Strava.](https://www.strava.com/athletes/58212778)\n\nWith your help, I want to raise as much as possible for people living with cancer.\n\nDonating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
